# 🐍 Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress learning Python as part of my 8-month **Programming & Cloud Roadmap**.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a strong foundation with **CS50P (Harvard’s Intro to Python)**
- Apply knowledge through **16 curated projects** from *100 Days of Python*
- Enhance projects to make them **portfolio-ready**
- Prepare for a **Tech Degree Apprenticeship** by showcasing growth and consistency

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `cs50p/` → Problem sets and projects from CS50P
- `100-days-projects/` → Selected projects from 100 Days of Python
- `enhanced-projects/` → Expanded projects with extra features
- `notes/` → Personal notes, study guides, and reflections

## 🚀 Learning Philosophy
Combine **computer science fundamentals** with **hands-on projects**:
- CS50P → Rigor and problem-solving methodology
- 100 Days → Practical, real-world applications
- Enhancements → Demonstrate initiative, creativity, and business focus

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- ✅ Week 1-2: Functions, conditionals, variables  
- ✅ Week 3-4: Loops, algorithms, string manipulation  
- 🔄 Ongoing: Data structures, OOP, file operations, automation

> This repository is a work in progress and will evolve as I advance through the roadmap. Follow along as I grow from **beginner Python** to **professional developer skills**.
